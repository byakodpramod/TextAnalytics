Description
-----------
The program file "jaccard_co.py" prints the descending order Jaccard Coefficient values for thorn separated file "discussions.thorn".
All the lines in "discussions.thorn" which appear before the thorn character "Ã¾" are stored as a list elements. Further these list elements are used to pass arguments to the 
unix diff command. The command will produce the difference between the passed list elements, the output will be further processed to find the Jaccard Coefficient. Likewise, each element 
of the list is compared to each other elements in the list to find the respective Jaccard Coefficient values.
If the output shows "1,2,0.564877", it means 0.564877 is the Jaccard Coefficient value for comparison made on 1 and 2 elements of the array.


Installing
----------
Use the below command to unzip the file uploaded
"tar xvzf pramod_duplicate_discussion.tar.gz -C <path>"

Above command will unzip a folder Pramod_Duplicate_Detection, in which "jaccard_co.py" and "discussions.thorn" files will be stored.

To execute the progrram file, run the below command
"python3 jaccard_co.py"

This will print all the Jaccard Coefficient values for each of the comparisons made.


Jaccard Coefficient
-------------------
j_co = (A intersection B) / (A union B)

For example if A = "ab" and B = "bb"
j_co = (1) / (3) = 0.333333

Ouput for the above comparison looks like below if "ab" was 1st element and "bb" was 2nd
[1,2,0.33333]

Also the program takes care to print the values in decending order.
i.e j_co(bb,bb) > j_co(ab,bb) > j_co(aa,bb);
